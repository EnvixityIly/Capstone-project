      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Bangladesh, the land of rivers and resilience, is a vibrant South Asian
        nation known for its lush green landscapes, dynamic culture, and
        entrepreneurial spirit. Since gaining independence in 1971, it has
        emerged as a growing economy with a deep sense of community and
        heritage.
