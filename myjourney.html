      <h2>My journey</h2>
      <p>
        I am fourteen now, but my school ID reads like a travel itinerary.
        Thanks to my moms ever-changing job, I have walked the halls of eight
        different schools across 5 cities—sometimes starting fresh in the middle
        of the term, backpack in hand and heart pounding.

      <h2>Finding Home in the Unknown</h2>
      <p>
        Each time we moved, I said goodbye to classrooms where Id learned my
        classmates quirks, favorite lunch spots, and after-school hangouts.
        Walking into a brand-new school meant introducing myself to strangers,
        learning new routines, and figuring out where the best seat in class was
        all before I even knew the teachers name. It was scary at first, but
        over time I discovered that being the “new kid” taught me how to make
        friends quickly and spot kindness in small gestures: a shared pencil, an
        inviting smile, or a seat saved at lunch.

      <h2>Lessons Beyond Textbooks</h2>
      <p>
        Switching schools so often didnt just sharpen my social skills—it showed
        me how to adapt. I learned to ask questions without embarrassment, jump
        into group projects with confidence, and navigate different teaching
        styles. I became resourceful, finding ways to keep up with varied
        curriculums and juggle new homework systems. More than anything, I
        learned resilience: even when the next move arrived on the horizon, I
        carried forward the friendships, lessons, and memories I'd made.

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        Moving eight times has shaped who I am: someone who sees change not as a
        setback, but as an opportunity to grow. Now, whenever I face a new
        challenge—whether its a surprise spelling quiz or joining a brand-new
        club—I remember the courage it took to step into a fresh classroom and
        promise myself: “You have done this before. You have got this again.”
